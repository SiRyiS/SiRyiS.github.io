It's the art of blending into the environment, leveraging those tools, commands, and functionalities already present to achieve objectives while minimizing the footprint of one's activities. By using the less conspicuous native utilities and system features, offensive security pros can conduct operations with greater stealth and effectiveness.</p> <p>In this blog, we'll discuss at a high level from the Linux environment perspective and explore simple interesting ways to enumerate, focusing on uncovering potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be leveraged. To illustrate these techniques, we'll dissect a few examples showcasing how to leverage built-in functionalities effectively, but first let's quickly discuss why living off the land is a great tactic:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> By leveraging native Linux utilities, offensive security pros can evade detection mechanisms that are often tuned to flag the use of suspicious or unauthorized tools. This stealthiness allows them to operate undetected within target environments for extended periods, increasing the likelihood of mission success.</li> <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Living off the land minimizes the need for deploying additional tools or software onto target systems, reducing the risk of detection and simplifying post-operation cleanup. This approach allows more focus on achieving objectives rather than worrying about leaving traces behind.</li> <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Linux's open-source nature and rich ecosystem of tools provide loads of possibilities for customization and adaptation. By mastering the Linux environment you can tailor techniques to suit the specific characteristics of each target, increasing the effectiveness of Ops.</li> <li><strong>Deniability:</strong> Since you are leveraging legitimate system functionalities, activities may appear benign to casual observers or forensic analysts. This plausible deniability can help offensive security pros deflect suspicion and avoid attribution, further enhancing operational security.</li> </ol> <h2>Potential Groups Enumeration</h2> <pre><code class="language-bash"> print_info "INFO" "Potential Groups: $(stat /*/*/* 2&gt;/dev/null | grep 'Gid:' | awk '{print $5,$6}' | tr ',' '\n' | sort -u)" </code></pre> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code>print_info "INFO" "Potential Groups:</code>: This function prints information to the console with an "INFO" tag.</li> <li><code>$(stat /*/*/* 2&gt;/dev/null | grep 'Gid:' | awk '{print $5,$6}' | tr ',' '\n' | sort -u)</code>: This command sequence retrieves group permissions across the file system. <ul> <li><code>stat /*/*/*</code>: Retrieves information about files and directories in the specified path.</li> <li><code>grep 'Gid:'</code>: Filters the output to lines containing the group ID information.</li> <li><code>awk '{print $5,$6}'</code>: Selects and prints the fifth and sixth columns, which represent the numeric group ID and group name, respectively.</li> <li><code>tr ',' '\n'</code>: Translates commas to newlines to separate multiple groups.</li> <li><code>sort -u</code>: Sorts the output alphabetically and removes duplicates.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Checking for Executable Permission Files</h2> <pre><code class="language-bash"> print_info "INFO" "Potential Executable Files: $(find / -type f -executable 2&gt;/dev/null)" </code></pre> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code>print_info "INFO" "Potential Executable Files:</code>: This function prints information to the console with an "INFO" tag.</li> <li><code>$(find / -type f -executable 2&gt;/dev/null)</code>: This command searches for executable files starting from the root directory. <ul> <li><code>find / -type f -executable</code>: Searches for files starting from the root directory ("/") that have executable permission set.</li> <li><code>2&gt;/dev/null</code>: Redirects error messages to /dev/null to suppress them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
